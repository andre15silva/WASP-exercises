+The test is trying to ensure that the function does not get stuck in an infinite loop by checking that the AST traversal does not exceed a certain number of nodes. The function uses a `visits` counter to keep track of the number of nodes visited and a `shouldRetraverse` method to check if the node should be revisited. The bug is that the function does not handle the case where the `shouldRetraverse` method returns `true` for a node that was already visited. This leads to an infinite loop.
 
-      Preconditions.checkState(visits < 10000, "too many interations");
-    } while (shouldRetraverse(node));
+To fix the bug, we need to add a check to make sure that we do not revisit a node that was already visited. We can do this by adding a `Set` to keep track of the visited nodes and checking if the current node is already in the `Set` before visiting it. If it is already in the `Set`, we skip the visit and move on to the next node.
 
-    exitNode(node);
-  }
+Here's a corrected version of the `traverse` function:
