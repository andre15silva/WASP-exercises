+The error message that you provided is not very helpful, can you please provide more context or information about the error you are trying to fix?
+
+I can see that the function is supposed to clone an element and return the cloned element, but it also calls the `classNames()` method on the cloned element, which is incorrect.
+
+I would recommend changing the return type of the function from `Element` to `ElementClone` or something similar, and then calling the `clone()` method instead of calling `classNames()` on the cloned element.
+
+Also, it would be helpful to also include a check for whether the cloned element is null before calling `clone()`.
