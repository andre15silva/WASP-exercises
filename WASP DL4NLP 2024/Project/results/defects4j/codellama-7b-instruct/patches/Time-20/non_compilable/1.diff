+The function is attempting to print a `DateTime` object with a time zone that is not valid for the given date and time. The `America/Dawson_Creek` time zone is 6 hours ahead of UTC, but the `DateTime` object was created with a time zone that is 8 hours ahead of UTC (which is the Pacific Time Zone). The `DateTimeZone.forID` method should be used to ensure that the time zone is valid for the given date and time.
