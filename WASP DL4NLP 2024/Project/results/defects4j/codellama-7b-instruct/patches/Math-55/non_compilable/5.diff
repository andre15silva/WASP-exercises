+I would start by understanding the problem better by analyzing the function. I will read the comments, understand the motivation behind the rescaling, and trace the code.
 
-      // rescale both vectors without losing precision,
-      // to ensure their norm are the same order of magnitude
+I believe that the bug is in the line where the cross product is computed, specifically, in the last three lines of code. The code is computing the cross product `v1` and `v2` instead of `v3` and `v2`.
 
-      // we reduce cancellation errors by preconditioning,
-      // we replace v1 by v3 = v1 - rho v2 with rho chosen in order to compute
-      // v3 without loss of precision. See Kahan lecture
-      // "Computing Cross-Products and Rotations in 2- and 3-Dimensional Euclidean Spaces"
-      // available at http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~wkahan/MathH110/Cross.pdf
-
-      // compute rho as an 8 bits approximation of v1.v2 / v2.v2
-
-
-      // compute cross product from v3 and v2 instead of v1 and v2
-      return new Vector3D(v1.y * v2.z - v1.z * v2.y, v1.z * v2.x - v1.x * v2.z, v1.x * v2.y - v1.y * v2.x);

+To fix the bug, I will replace the code in the last three lines with the following code:
