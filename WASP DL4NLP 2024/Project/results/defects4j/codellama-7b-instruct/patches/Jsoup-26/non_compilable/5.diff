+Yes, of course. I apologize for the confusion earlier. I will provide more information to help you resolve the issue.
+The buggy function is the `clean(Document)` function in the provided code.
+
+The `clean(Document)` function is supposed to take a document as input and return a cleaned document that contains only the elements that are allowed by the `Whitelist.basic()` whitelist. However, the function is not working correctly and is returning an empty document instead of the expected cleaned document.
+
+The `clean(Document)` function is using the `copySafeNodes(Node from, Node to)` method to copy the nodes from the `dirtyDocument.body()` to the `clean.body()` node. However, this method is not working correctly and is returning `null` instead of the expected cleaned body.
+
+The test case `handlesFramesets()` is failing because the `clean(Document)` function is returning an empty document instead of the expected cleaned document.
+
+I believe the bug is in the `copySafeNodes(Node from, Node to)` method, which is not working correctly to copy the nodes from the `dirtyDocument.body()` to the `clean.body()` node. The method is returning `null` instead of the expected cleaned body.
+
+I hope this information helps you resolve the issue. Please let me know if you need any further assistance.
