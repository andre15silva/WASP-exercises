+To summarize the problem, there are several arrays that are passed to the function, and the function should return true if the arrays are equal. However, the function is not working correctly, and is failing the test cases.
+
+The problem is that there is a bug in the function that is causing it to return false for some test cases, even when the arrays are actually equal. The function should be fixed so that it returns true for all test cases.
+
+The bug is related to the way the function handles the equal case, and in particular, the way it compares the elements of the arrays. The function should be fixed so that it correctly compares the elements of the arrays.
+
+I hope this helps to clarify the problem. Let me know if you have any other questions.
