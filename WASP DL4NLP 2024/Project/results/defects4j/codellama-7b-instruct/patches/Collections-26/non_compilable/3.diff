+Here are a few suggestions for how you could improve this code:
+
+1. Make sure that the hash code is calculated correctly. In this case, the hash code should be a sum of the hash codes of all the items in the list.
+2. Use a built-in function to calculate the hash code, rather than rolling your own. For example, you could use the `sum()` function to calculate the hash code.
+3. Consider using a different data structure to store the keys, such as a set or a tuple. This would make it easier to calculate the hash code and would also make the code more efficient.
