+I apologize for the incomplete information provided in the original question. Here is a more complete version of the code, along with some context and the expected input and output:
 
-        return deferredBlockStreams.get(0);
-    }
+The code is from an open-source project, and the function is part of a Java class that implements a 7z file format reader. The 7z format is a compressed archive format that is commonly used for distributing data.
+
+The function is supposed to return the current input stream for the 7z archive being read by the class. The current input stream is the stream that is currently being read by the class. The function should return the current input stream, or throw an exception if no current input stream is available.
+
+The input to the function is the deferredBlockStreams, which is a list of input streams that have been added to the class but not yet read. The function should return the current input stream from the deferredBlockStreams, or throw an exception if the list is empty.
+
+The expected output of the function is the current input stream for the 7z archive, or an exception if no current input stream is available.
+
+Here is a fixed version of the function:
