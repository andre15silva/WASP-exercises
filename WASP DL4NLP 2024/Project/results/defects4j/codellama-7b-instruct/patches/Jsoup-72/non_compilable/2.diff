+You're correct, the code is trying to create a string of length -1, which is not a valid length. The bug is in the calculation of the string length.
 
-        // get from cache
-        final int index = hash & stringCache.length - 1;
-        String cached = stringCache[index];
+The function `rangeEquals` checks if the specified range of characters in the input array equals the specified string. The function calls `rangeEquals` multiple times in the course of its execution. Each time it calls `rangeEquals`, it passes in a start offset and a length. The length is calculated by subtracting the start offset from the end offset.
 
-        if (cached == null) { // miss, add
-            cached = new String(charBuf, start, count);
-            stringCache[index] = cached;
-        } else { // hashcode hit, check equality
-            if (rangeEquals(charBuf, start, count, cached)) { // hit
-                return cached;
-            } else { // hashcode conflict
-                cached = new String(charBuf, start, count);
-                stringCache[index] = cached; // update the cache, as recently used strings are more likely to show up again
-            }
-        }
-        return cached;
-    }
+The bug is that the function calls `rangeEquals` with a length of -1, which is not a valid length. The function should not call `rangeEquals` with a length of -1, because it will cause an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` when it tries to access the characters in the input array.
+
+I would recommend modifying the function to check the validity of the length before calling `rangeEquals`. If the length is negative or exceeds the number of characters in the input array, the function should return false immediately.
+
+Here is an example of how the function could be modified:
