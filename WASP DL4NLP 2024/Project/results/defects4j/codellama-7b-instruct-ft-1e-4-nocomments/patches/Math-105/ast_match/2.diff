      * Returns the <a href="http://www.xycoon.com/SumOfSquares.htm">
      * sum of squared errors</a> (SSE) associated with the regression 
      * model.
      * <p>
      * The sum is computed using the computational formula
      * <p>
      * <code>SSE = SYY - (SXY * SXY / SXX)</code>
      * <p>
      * where <code>SYY</code> is the sum of the squared deviations of the y
      * values about their mean, <code>SXX</code> is similarly defined and
      * <code>SXY</code> is the sum of the products of x and y mean deviations.
      * <p>
      * The sums are accumulated using the updating algorithm referenced in 
      * {@link #addData}.  
      * <p>
-     * The return value is constrained to be non-negative - i.e., if due to 
-     * rounding errors the computational formula returns a negative result, 
-     * 0 is returned.
+     * The return value is constrained to be non-negative - a call to this 
+     * method may return a negative value because of numerical rounding errors. 
+     * To avoid these problems, {@link #getSSERror()} should be used instead.
      * <p>
      * <strong>Preconditions</strong>: <ul>
      * <li>At least two observations (with at least two different x values)
      * must have been added before invoking this method. If this method is 
      * invoked before a model can be estimated, <code>Double,NaN</code> is
      * returned.
      * </li></ul>
