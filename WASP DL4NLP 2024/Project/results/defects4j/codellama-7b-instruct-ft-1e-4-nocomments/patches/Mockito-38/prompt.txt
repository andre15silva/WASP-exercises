The following code contains a buggy function:
```java
    private boolean toStringEquals(Matcher m, Object arg) {
        return StringDescription.toString(m).equals(arg.toString());
    }

```

The code fails the following test:
```java
    @Test
    public void shouldWorkFineWhenGivenArgIsNull() {
        //when
        Integer[] suspicious = tool.getSuspiciouslyNotMatchingArgsIndexes((List) Arrays.asList(new Equals(20)), new Object[] {null});
        
        //then
        assertEquals(0, suspicious.length);
    }

```

With the following test error:
```
java.lang.NullPointerException
```

Please provide a fixed version of the buggy function, and only that function:
