      * <code>SSE = SYY - (SXY * SXY / SXX)</code>

      * values about their mean, <code>SXX</code> is similarly defined and
      * <code>SXY</code> is the sum of the products of x and y mean deviations.
      * <p>
      * The sums are accumulated using the updating algorithm referenced in 
      * {@link #addData}.  
      * <p>

-     * rounding errors the computational formula returns a negative result,
