      * Gets the millisecond offset to subtract from local time to get UTC time.
      * This offset can be used to undo adding the offset obtained by getOffset.
      *
      * <pre>
      * millisLocal == millisUTC   + getOffset(millisUTC)
      * millisUTC   == millisLocal - getOffsetFromLocal(millisLocal)
      * </pre>
      *
      * NOTE: After calculating millisLocal, some error may be introduced. At
      * offset transitions (due to DST or other historical changes), ranges of
      * local times may map to different UTC times.
      * <p>
      * This method will return an offset suitable for calculating an instant
      * after any DST gap. For example, consider a zone with a cutover
      * from 01:00 to 01:59:<br />
      * Input: 00:00  Output: 00:00<br />
      * Input: 00:30  Output: 00:30<br />
      * Input: 01:00  Output: 02:00<br />
      * Input: 01:30  Output: 02:30<br />
      * Input: 02:00  Output: 02:00<br />
      * Input: 02:30  Output: 02:30<br />
      * <p>
      * During a DST overlap (where the local time is ambiguous) this method will return
      * the earlier instant. The combination of these two rules is to always favour
      * daylight (summer) time over standard (winter) time.
      * <p>
      * NOTE: Prior to v2.0, the DST overlap behaviour was not defined and varied by hemisphere.
      * Prior to v1.5, the DST gap behaviour was also not defined.
      *
      * @param instantLocal  the millisecond instant, relative to this time zone, to get the offset for
      * @return the millisecond offset to subtract from local time to get UTC time
