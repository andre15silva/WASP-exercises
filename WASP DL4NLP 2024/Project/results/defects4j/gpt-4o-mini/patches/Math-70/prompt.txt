You are an automatic program repair tool. Your task is to fix the provided buggy code.

The following code contains a buggy function:
```java
    /** {@inheritDoc} */
    public double solve(final UnivariateRealFunction f, double min, double max, double initial)
        throws MaxIterationsExceededException, FunctionEvaluationException {
        return solve(min, max);
    }

```

The code fails the following test:
```java
    public void testMath369() throws Exception {
        UnivariateRealFunction f = new SinFunction();
        UnivariateRealSolver solver = new BisectionSolver();
        assertEquals(Math.PI, solver.solve(f, 3.0, 3.2, 3.1), solver.getAbsoluteAccuracy());
    }

```

With the following test error:
```
java.lang.NullPointerException
```

Please provide a fixed version of the buggy function, and only that function:
