+ To improve the performance of this code, I would consider the following optimizations:
+ 
+ 1. Use a profiler to identify performance bottlenecks in the code. This will help you understand which parts of the code are causing performance issues and where you should focus your optimization efforts.
+ 
+ 2. Optimize the `transform` method. By using a more efficient data structure such as a `Set` or a `HashSet`, you can reduce the time it takes to search for elements in the list.
+ 
+ 3. Avoid unnecessary allocations. When constructing the `EnsembleSummaryView` object, you create a copy of the `participantViews` list and pass it as an argument to the constructor. To improve performance, you can use a method that accepts a `List` as an argument instead, which will avoid the unnecessary allocation.
+ 
+ 4. Use more efficient data structures. By using a more efficient data structure such as a `Map` or a `HashMap`, you can reduce the time it takes to look up elements in the list.
+
+ 5. Avoid unnecessary method calls. The `toString` method is called twice on the `ensemble.meetingLink()` object, which can be avoided by assigning the result of the `toString` method to a variable and passing that variable to the `EnsembleSummaryView` constructor instead.
+
+Here is the fixed code:
