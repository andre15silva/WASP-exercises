-    spans[0] = 1; // Span of first element is always 1
+The bug in the code is due to the fact that the span of the current element is computed based on the price of the element itself, rather than its index. This causes the algorithm to fail when considering the case where the price of an element is less than or equal to the price of any previous element.
 
-    Stack<Integer> indexStack = new Stack<>();
+If I were not provided with the solution and had to approach the problem on my own, I would first identify the bug by reading the code carefully and tracing it on paper or using a debugger. Once I have identified the bug, I would try to understand the reasoning behind the code and see if I can reproduce the bug manually.
 
-    // Push the index of first element
-    indexStack.push(0);

-    for (int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
-      while (!indexStack.isEmpty()
-          && prices[indexStack.peek()] <= prices[i])
-        indexStack.pop();
-
-      // If index stack is empty, the price at index 'i'
-      // is greater than all previous values
-      if (indexStack.isEmpty())
-        spans[i] = i + 1;

-
-      indexStack.push(i);
-    }

-    return spans;

+Next, I would try to find a simple way to fix the bug. In this case, the simplest fix is to simply change the line
