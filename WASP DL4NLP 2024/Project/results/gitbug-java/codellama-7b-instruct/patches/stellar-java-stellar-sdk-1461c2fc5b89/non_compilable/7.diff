+It looks like the function `isSorobanTransaction()` is trying to determine if a given transaction is a `Soroban` transaction, but it has several issues.
+
+First, it's checking the length of `mOperations` array, but it's not making sure that the array is not null. If `mOperations` is null, then it will throw a `NullPointerException`.
+
+Second, it's assuming that the first operation in the array is an `InvokeHostFunctionOperation`, `BumpSequenceOperation`, or `RestoreFootprintOperation`, but it's not checking the type of the operation.
+
+Finally, it's returning true if the operation is not one of the three types, which is the opposite of what it should be doing.
+
+Here's a possible fix for the function:
