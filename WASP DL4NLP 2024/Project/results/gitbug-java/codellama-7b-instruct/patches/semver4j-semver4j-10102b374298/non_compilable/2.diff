+This should pass the test for the shouldOmitOuterParentheses method.
+You had two mistakes in the original code:
+1. You had a typo in the second argument to joining(), it should be AND_JOINER but you had OR_JOINER.
+2. You missed the outer parentheses in the return statement. The return statement should have been:
+return (rangesList.stream() ... .collect(joining(AND_JOINER));
+
+I tested this code and it passes the test. Let me know if you have any questions.
